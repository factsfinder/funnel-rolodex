# Local API

This Skeleton API was provided using Express: `^4.17.1` and was built so that a version can be boot-strapped and tested with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).

Candidates are expected to write their endpoint implementations inside of `create-server.js`.  Changes are not required to `index.js`, but if you feel you can improve the implementation feel free.

## Getting Started

First run `npm install`

To run the Server you can `npm run start` or `node index.js`

## Passing Solution

It is expected for a passing solution that the tests pass.  There is a github-action in place that will verify the work, but one can run the tests locally using `npm test`.
